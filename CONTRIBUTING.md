### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grow. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: This label means that something needs further development work.
- **qa-needed**: This label means that further review needs to be done.
- **documentation-needed**: This means that a documentation needs to be created.
- **bug-high-priority**: This means that a major bug has been found and placed on a high priority.
- **bug-low-priority**: This means that a minor bug has been found and placed on a low priority.
- **help-wanted**: This label means that something needs major work to be done.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
